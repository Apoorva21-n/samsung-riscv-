Install VirtualBox (sudo apt install virtualbox), create a new virtual machine, and load the .vdi file by selecting "Use an existing virtual hard disk file."
Inside the VM, write your C program using nano sum.c to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
Install the RISC-V toolchain, build it, and add it to PATH .
Compile the program (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc sum.c -o sum) and run it.

c code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
